    - To upload the files into a project, enable "Upload as project" and configure the settings.
      Only the project name is required.

3. Paste the links you want to upload in the left box, and type a custom filename if you want in the right box.
    - Write your filenames on newlines, with a gap for those you want to upload with the original name.

4. Choose the hosts you want to upload to.
    - Deselect all hosts or click "Select user favourites" to use the favourite hosts associated with your MultiUp
      account.

5. Click on "Upload to MultiUp" to upload your files.
