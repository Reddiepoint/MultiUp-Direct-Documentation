# Introduction

This documentation provides comprehensive help for using [MultiUp Direct](https://github.com/Reddiepoint/MultiUp-Direct).

## What is MultiUp Direct?

[MultiUp Direct](https://github.com/Reddiepoint/MultiUp-Direct) is an application written in Rust that extracts direct
links from [MultiUp](https://multiup.io/), allows for the unlocking of these links with a Debrid service and allows for
the remote upload of the content back to MultiUp, making it easier to mirror and share content with others.

## Features

* Convert bulk short and long links into direct links within seconds, with support for MultiUp projects.
* Ability to re-check host validity.
* Open and select specific hosts and links.
* Built-in Debrid service support for [AllDebrid](https://alldebrid.com/) and [RealDebrid](https://real-debrid.com/).
* Remote upload of content to MultiUp with data streaming (bypassing Debrid service restrictions).
